     DRY is a good principle, but not every code that looks alike is duplicate. Before deleting duplication, investigate if it's just an accidental duplication: code that seems the same but conceptually represents something else
     
     Mixing differenc concepts makes it harder to reason about separate parts of the system in isolacion, increasing its complexity
     
     This test may look "duplicate", but it's an "accidental duplication"
     
     Although we decided to keep the "Save" and "Load" methods in the samy type, they belong to different contexts/Use Cases
     
     By creating separate tests, if we ever decide to break those actions in separate types, it's much easier to do so The tests are already separated and with all the necessary assertions
     
     But in the future it can breaks into two types, so we don't want to make this happen.
